    { q: "What is the response latency for AI Calling Agents?", a: "By combining low-latency text-to-speech pipelines, high-speed LLMs (such as Gemini 1.5 Flash), and optimized VOIP trunks, we achieve an ultra-low latency of under 800ms, making conversations feel completely natural." },
    { q: "Can we use our own phone numbers and SIP trunks?", a: "Yes, we support native SIP trunk registration and BYOC (Bring Your Own Carrier). You can easily map your existing Twilio, Exotel, Tata Telephony, or Zadarma channels straight to our dialer." },
    { q: "Is the Conversational AI HIPAA and GDPR compliant?", a: "Absolutely. All patient interaction logs, transcriptions, and database connections are fully encrypted in transit and at rest. We sign business associate agreements (BAAs) with medical enterprises." },
    { q: "How does the n8n webhook routing work?", a: "When any conversational trigger occurs (e.g., WhatsApp reply or booking slot selected), an n8n webhook is hit instantly, processing downstream actions like sending confirmation emails, creating deals, or updating rosters." },
    { q: "What is the setup cost and monthly commitment?", a: "We offer tailored subscription pricing matching your conversation volume. Standard setups start with no long-term contracts, and include fully managed onboarding workshops." },
    { q: "How does RCS Messaging compare to traditional SMS?", a: "RCS (Rich Communication Services) turns standard SMS into an app-like interactive media center. You can include carousel cards, verified sender badges, responsive buttons, and 1-click checkout buttons, boosting conversion rates by 3x." },
    { q: "Can the AI Calling agents handle multiple languages?", a: "Yes, our voice models support automatic language detection and translation across 30+ global languages, including English, Spanish, French, Hindi, and regional dialects, automatically adjusting accents dynamically." },
    { q: "Do we need an official Meta WhatsApp Business API account?", a: "We manage the entire Meta onboarding process for you! We will guide you through business verification and register your official Meta developer credentials to ensure 100% compliance." },
    { q: "How does the calendar synchronization work?", a: "We synchronize natively with Google Calendar, Zoom, Outlook, and Microsoft Teams. The AI model checks real-time availability slots and locks appointment times directly, preventing double booking." },
    { q: "What fallback mechanisms exist if the AI agent gets stuck?", a: "If the conversation sentiment changes or the customer explicitly requests human help, the bot smoothly executes an 'Agent Handoff' action, transferring the call or chat to a live support representative with full transcript logs." },
    { q: "Is there a dashboard to monitor live conversations in real-time?", a: "Yes! GrowthOS comes with a unified chronological dashboard that shows live chat timelines, sentiment scores, and dialer recordings, giving managers complete operational control." }
