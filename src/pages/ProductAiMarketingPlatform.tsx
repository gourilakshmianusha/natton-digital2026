Hey {{First_Name}},

Most skincare lines are built to strip. They use heavy surfactants to create a satisfying lather—but that lather is actively eroding your lipid barrier, leaving you vulnerable to accelerated aging.

In ancient Ayurveda, skincare isn't about scrubbing. It's about feeding.

Tomorrow, I'll show you the exact 3 botanicals dermatologists are using to rebuild natural lipid layers in under 7 days. Keep your eyes on your inbox.

Warmly,
The Natton Glow Team`

The "10-step glass skin routine" was a marketing masterpiece invented to sell 10 products instead of 1. But your skin is a living organ, not a kitchen counter to be bleached. Here is why the industry is returning to Ayurvedic botanical simplicity. 👇

**(2/5)** Harvester methods matter. Active chemical ingredients degrade in plastic bottles on retail shelves. Cold-pressed botanical extracts preserved in violet glass retain original phytonutrient potency for up to 18 months without synthetic chemical binders.

**(3/5)** True skin health comes from nourishing your moisture barrier, not stripping it. Look for lipid-identical plant ceramides like moringa and kumkumadi.

    },
    {
      q: "How is it different from Jasper or Writesonic?",
      a: "While Jasper and Writesonic only generate text, Natton integrates content directly with real-world distribution. It optimize layouts for AI Search engines (AEO), automatically schedules Meta/Google ad structures, and links to your CRM pipelines for live lead scoring."
    },
    {
      q: "What is AEO (AI Engine Optimization)?",
      a: "AEO is the next stage of SEO. Traditional search engines list blue links; new AI interfaces like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude provide direct conversational summaries. We format your schema, micro-data, and site semantics so these AI models actively recommend your brand as the top solution."
    },
    {
      q: "Can we link our official Meta Ads Manager account?",
      a: "Yes. Our platform utilizes official Meta Cloud API protocols. You can generate creative headings, map target demographics, set budgets, and push directly to your Facebook and Instagram ad systems without leaving the Natton dashboard."
    },
    {
      q: "How does the AI Reputation Manager protect our brand?",
      a: "It actively monitors Google Review APIs and Trustpilot feeds. When customers post reviews, our NLP system reads the text, detects sentiment, and generates beautiful, context-aware responses, addressing client comments directly in seconds."
    },
    {
      q: "Does this require custom API keys from OpenAI or Google?",
      a: "No. Our enterprise subscriptions include full server-side Gemini API routing with complete data privacy. Your proprietary product formulations and client information are never used to train public LLM models."
    },
    {
      q: "How does the AI Lead Scoring mechanism work?",
      a: "It monitors prospect behavior (such as email opens, pricing page visits, form fills). The system then calculates interest density and labels hot leads instantly, allowing your sales advisors to prioritize outbound calls with high precision."
    },
    {
      q: "Can we run this on top of GoHighLevel or HubSpot?",
      a: "Absolutely. We provide bidirectional synchronization webhooks. You can trigger lead alerts, push scraped data, or update CRM pipeline columns inside HubSpot or GHL automatically via n8n integration."
    },
    {
      q: "Is there support for regional Indian languages?",
      a: "Yes. Our content studio generates premium copy in Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Bengali, and 12 other local languages to help you target regional audiences."
    },
    {
      q: "How secure is our database on your servers?",
      a: "We operate on secure Google Cloud (Cloud Run) containers. All databases are isolated with AES-256 local encrypted profiles and are fully HIPAA and GDPR compliant."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the training process for our in-house copywriters?",
      a: "Our customer success team provides a 2-hour onboarding webinar, direct video tutorials, and dedicated Slack channels to assist your marketing teams in deploying automated pipelines."
    },
    {
      q: "Do you offer a free trial?",
      a: "We do not offer a generic free tier, but we provide a 100% money-back guarantee for your first 14 days if the AI models do not boost your operational speed by at least 2x."
    },
    {
      q: "What payment gateways are supported?",
      a: "We integrate with Razorpay and Stripe to handle credit cards, debit cards, UPI payments, and automated corporate subscription invoices seamlessly."
    },
    {
      q: "Is there a limit on how many blogs or ads we can generate?",
      a: "Our plans are designed for unrestricted growth. While the Starter plan has soft keyword lookup limits, our popular Growth and Pro tiers support unlimited text and SEO outlines."
    },
