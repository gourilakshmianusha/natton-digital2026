  // Exactly 15 questions in accordion FAQ
  const faqs = [
    {
      q: "What makes Natton Digital different from a traditional marketing agency?",
      a: "Traditional agencies only focus on top-of-funnel traffic generation, leaving you with cold leads and manual spreadsheets. Natton Digital is an AI-first growth partner: we generate high-intent traffic and instantly pipe it through custom n8n automations, CRM pipelines, and autonomous calling agents to book real sales meetings."
    },
    {
      q: "Do you replace our existing CRM, or do you integrate with it?",
      a: "We are built for flexibility. We can either deploy a highly optimized CRM framework on GoHighLevel (GrowthOS™) to automate your customer list completely, or build custom n8n nodes to securely sync and clean data in your legacy CRM system like HubSpot, Salesforce, or Zoho."
    },
    {
      q: "What is n8n and why do you use it for workflows instead of Zapier?",
      a: "Zapier is a great tool for simple tasks, but it quickly becomes extremely expensive and visually unmanageable for complex enterprise logic. We use n8n because it allows us to build self-healing, multi-node webhook databases with advanced JavaScript filters, direct database integrations, and robust security—saving our clients thousands in monthly Zapier tasks."
    },
    {
      q: "How do your custom AI Calling Agents work?",
      a: "Our voice systems utilize advanced text-to-speech models and low-latency speech recognition to engage in natural, human-sounding telephone conversations. They make outbound follow-ups or answer inbound inquiries, check calendars, qualify criteria, and directly book appointment slots inside your CRM in milliseconds."
    },
    {
      q: "What are GrowthOS™, BusinessOS™, and AgenticOS™?",
      a: "GrowthOS™ handles automatic customer acquisition, including ad creatives, email warmups, and messaging. BusinessOS™ automates your internal processes, such as invoicing and support tickets. AgenticOS™ is our advanced coordination layer where multiple autonomous AI agents execute complex corporate tasks without human oversight."
    },
    {
      q: "Can your conversational agents support regional Indian languages?",
      a: "Yes. Our AI voice dialers and WhatsApp chatbots are equipped with multilingual routers capable of speaking and understanding English, Hindi, and regional languages like Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada, making them ideal for Indian MSMEs."
    },
    {
      q: "Is Natton Digital's infrastructure secure and GDPR compliant?",
      a: "Absolutely. Security is our primary engineering mandate. All client data is encrypted with AES-256 protocols, routed securely through SSL/TLS, and hosted on isolated server nodes. We design HIPAA-compliant triages and GDPR-compliant databases, ensuring strict patient and customer privacy."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the typical timeline to build and launch an AI Agent system?",
      a: "For standard CRM automation and WhatsApp chatbots, we can deploy the initial system within 10 to 14 business days. Specialized custom RAG systems, multilingual voice dialers, and deep n8n database pipelines generally take between 3 and 6 weeks to fully audit, build, and optimize."
    },
    {
      q: "Do we need our own OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google developer accounts?",
      a: "No. We can securely host and route the models through our enterprise API keys, billing you purely on consumption. Alternatively, if you have strict compliance guidelines, we can easily configure the systems to run inside your own Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure private environments."
    },
    {
      q: "How does your pricing model work? Is it based on performance?",
      a: "We offer structured project-based build retainers for our architecture setups, and monthly optimization programs for continuous model training. For select clients with qualified sales histories, we also offer dynamic hybrid packages linked directly to booked revenue."
    },
    {
      q: "What is SEO + AEO and how do you optimize for AI-first search?",
      a: "Search Engine Optimization (SEO) gets you found on Google. Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) ensures your brand is selected as the top primary answer when users query AI engines like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity. We structure your website's metadata, schema codes, and technical blogs to ensure maximum AI search dominance."
    },
    {
      q: "Can you automate cold outreach pipelines without domain blacklisting?",
      a: "Yes. We set up isolated custom domain structures with complete SPF, DKIM, and DMARC verification. We run automatic slow-warmup schedules using specialized inbox networks, ensuring your outbound prospecting campaigns reach primary inboxes instead of spam folders."
    },
    {
      q: "How does the WhatsApp Business API integration work?",
      a: "We integrate directly with the Meta Cloud API. This allows us to broadcast targeted customer coupons, recover abandoned shopping carts, send automated utility notices, and activate intelligent chatbots capable of guiding users through product catalogs with native checkouts."
    },
    {
      q: "What level of ongoing support and maintenance do you provide?",
      a: "We do not believe in transactional relationships. Our monthly optimization services act as your fractional Chief AI Officer: we audit system analytics, upgrade underlying models, update prompt guardrails, and constantly fine-tune workflow nodes as technology evolves."
    },
    {
      q: "Do you offer an initial pilot program before committing to an enterprise rollout?",
      a: "Yes. We offer an initial Diagnostic Pilot where we map out your exact system leaks and deploy a single high-impact automation (like a WhatsApp lead-capture bot) over a 2-week testing period, allowing your team to experience the tangible cash and time savings firsthand."
