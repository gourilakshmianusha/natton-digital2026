  // FAQs (Exactly 20 rich items requested)
  const pricingFaqs = [
    {
      q: "What is the difference between AI Marketing Platform™, GrowthOS™, and BusinessOS™?",
      a: "AI Marketing Platform™ focuses on organic and paid user acquisition (SEO, Google/Meta Ads, AI Content Studio). GrowthOS™ is our advanced AI-powered CRM designed for pipeline mapping, lead scoring, and customer nurturing. BusinessOS™ is our unified multi-channel communication engine that powers WhatsApp APIs, automated cloud telephony dialers, live chat sync, and internal alert triggers."
    },
    {
      q: "Are Meta charges included in the WhatsApp Automation plan?",
      a: "No. The ₹4,999/month platform fee covers the Natton Digital unified dashboard, broadcast schedulers, bot triggers, and n8n flow integrations. Meta conversation fees (utility vs. marketing conversation charges) are billed directly based on actual Meta country pricing matrices."
    },
    {
      q: "Do you offer a discount for annual billing plans?",
      a: "Yes! Choosing our Annual plans saves you 20% across all primary platform tiers. For example, the AI Marketing Starter plan is ₹24,999 monthly, but bills at a discounted rate of ₹2,39,999 annually (saving ₹60,000 yearly)."
    },
    {
      q: "Is there an setup or onboarding fee for setting up these custom CRM nodes?",
      a: "For Starter and basic tiers, setup is completely self-serve with standard tutorials. For our Growth and Scale tiers, our engineering team handles standard pipeline mappings, DNS verification, and CRM imports at no extra charge. Full-scale custom legacy SAP/Tally ERP integrations are quoted separately."
    },
    {
      q: "What is AgenticOS™ and how is it different from normal automations?",
      a: "Normal automations (like standard webhooks) are static, linear rules (IF this THEN that). AgenticOS™ deploys cognitive AI agents powered by Gemini. These agents reason, evaluate client intent scores, read documents, draft contextual customized emails, verify accounting balances, and orchestrate complex decision-making processes autonomously."
    },
    {
      q: "Can we downgrade, upgrade, or cancel our monthly subscription at any time?",
      a: "Yes. All monthly plans are entirely pay-as-you-go with no locked contracts. You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel directly from your client Billing Portal. Annual plans are contracted for 12 months with the 20% discount applied upfront."
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need separate licenses for OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini to run the AI features?",
      a: "No! All built-in AI functions (AI copywriters, lead scores, voice transcriptions, agent triages) run on Natton Digital's enterprise servers and are fully bundled within your plan quota. You do not need to purchase any secondary AI API keys."
    },
    {
      q: "How does the custom n8n automation service work?",
      a: "If you have specific workflows (e.g. sync Excel logs to Google Sheets, pull WhatsApp messages and format PDF quotes, send SMS reminders to teammates), our engineers compile these on a high-speed private n8n node. We charge a one-time build fee starting at ₹25,000, and hosting is completely free."
    },
    {
      q: "Do you support White Label partnerships for agencies or consulting partners?",
      a: "Yes, we offer White Label partner programs. Agencies can resell our CRM, WhatsApp automations, and AI Calling platforms under their own brand, logos, and custom domains. Contact our partner desks via the pricing form to receive detailed pricing sheets."
    },
    {
      q: "How secure is my CRM data when integrated with Natton Digital?",
      a: "Enterprise-grade safety is our absolute standard. We are ISO 27001 certified and SOC2 ready. All client data and contact details are fully encrypted in transit (using TLS 1.3) and at rest (using AES-256 tokens) with secure Firebase user-auth roles."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the voice-calling latency on your AI Calling Agents?",
      a: "Our Voice AI calling solutions operate under 1.2 seconds conversational latency, powered by advanced text-to-speech models and low-latency telephony lines. This provides an incredibly smooth, human-like voice conversation experience."
    },
    {
      q: "What local payment gateways do you support?",
      a: "We support Stripe, Razorpay, Cashfree, PayPal, and PhonePe PG integrations. This allows you to collect payments worldwide or via UPI, card, net banking, or local wallets with instant status callbacks back to your CRM."
    },
    {
      q: "Are there any hidden API limits or database transaction fees?",
      a: "No hidden fees. Each plan clearly lists its included contact lists, workflow limits, and messaging counts. High-volume custom tiers can scale-up dynamically with predictable, transparent overage rates."
    },
    {
      q: "Do you offer HIPAA-compliant hosting configurations for medical clinics?",
      a: "Yes. For medical centers and diagnostic labs, we deploy our secure, isolated Private Gateway networks to ensure patient data remains strictly isolated, utilizing HIPAA-safe notifications instead of raw text patient charts."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I migrate existing contact lists from Salesforce or HubSpot easily?",
      a: "Absolutely! GrowthOS supports direct JSON and CSV imports. Our support experts will guide you through mapping custom fields so that zero historical client data or tags are lost."
    },
    {
      q: "What level of support do you provide on the Starter plans?",
      a: "Starter plans receive standard 48-hour email support and full access to our extensive Help Center, interactive video tutorials, and API documentation hubs."
    },
    {
      q: "What does the 'Dedicated Success Manager' include in the Enterprise tier?",
      a: "Your Dedicated Success Manager serves as your private strategic partner. They coordinate with your engineering team, write custom n8n flows, audit campaign ROIs monthly, and conduct live employee training webinars."
    },
    {
      q: "What is RCS messaging, and is it better than standard SMS marketing?",
      a: "RCS (Rich Communication Services) is the modern upgrade to SMS for Android users. It supports full rich branding, verification badges, clickable carousels, action buttons, and complete checkout journeys right inside the default text inbox."
    },
    {
      q: "Is there a free trial option available to test the platform?",
      a: "Yes, we offer full sandbox access during our product demonstrations. Book a live demo call with our experts to review custom modules built for your exact industry, with full mock playfields."
    },
    {
      q: "Where are Natton Digital's server clusters hosted?",
      a: "Our core edge architecture is deployed across redundant Vercel and Google Cloud Run container arrays globally, with local Indian regions in Mumbai to ensure optimal speed and compliance."
