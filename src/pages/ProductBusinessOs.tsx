      a: "BusinessOS™ is an omnichannel customer communication and engagement platform that consolidates WhatsApp, RCS messaging, AI voice calls, Live Chat, and helpdesk tickets into a single elegant workspace, empowering teams with high-efficiency workflows."
    },
    {
      q: "How does the AI Calling Agent differ from traditional interactive voice response (IVR)?",
      a: "Traditional IVR systems force users through frustrating dial-pad menus. BusinessOS™ AI Calling Agents use natural spoken conversational NLP. They understand customer queries, check real-time calendars, log customer tags, and schedule appointments instantly with clean, human-like cadence."
    },
    {
      q: "Can we use our official WhatsApp Business API numbers?",
      a: "Yes. BusinessOS™ seamlessly integrates with Meta WhatsApp Cloud API guidelines. You can map your existing official business phone numbers, configure broadcasts, activate smart chatbots, and run dynamic catalog checkout pipelines."
    },
    {
      q: "How does BusinessOS™ compare to Intercom or Zendesk?",
      a: "Unlike traditional platforms that charge separate, premium costs for chat widgets, WhatsApp API connections, call dialers, and internal ticketing, BusinessOS™ delivers a fully unified workspace at a fraction of the cost, consolidating omnichannel records inside a single, zero-latency database."
    },
    {
      q: "What is RCS messaging, and is it supported?",
      a: "RCS (Rich Communication Services) is the modern upgrade to SMS for Android and Apple devices. BusinessOS™ supports verified sender profiles, rich media carousels, custom quick replies, and real-time delivery trackers directly in our interface."
    },
    {
      q: "Can we synchronize data with our HubSpot or GoHighLevel CRM?",
      a: "Absolutely! We provide out-of-the-box bidirectional webhook interfaces. You can sync tags, update deal stages, log phone call audio, or trigger follow-up SMS campaigns inside HubSpot, Salesforce, or GHL automatically."
    },
    {
      q: "Does AI Calling handle regional languages or dialects?",
      a: "Yes. Our AI voice modules support English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Marathi, Bengali, and various localized accents to provide a warm, comfortable customer service experience across multiple regions."
    },
    {
      q: "Is call recording and agent monitoring compliant?",
      a: "Yes, fully. All cloud telephony calls are recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for quality assurance with complete compliance. You can configure consent messages and toggle local compliance toggles in one click."
    },
    {
      q: "How does the ticketing system escalate SLA breaches?",
      a: "You can define flexible ticket priorities (Urgent, High, Medium, Low) and specific response window agreements (SLAs). If an agent does not reply within the set timeline, BusinessOS™ automatically pushes notifications to channel supervisors and reassigns ownership."
    },
    {
      q: "Can our support staff write internal co-worker notes?",
      a: "Yes! The Team Inbox supports collaborative tags, internal mentions (e.g. @Rahul), and hidden private notes that customers cannot see, keeping communication clean and coordinated."
    },
    {
      q: "Does this solution require expensive hardware?",
      a: "No hardware required at all. BusinessOS™ is a 100% cloud-hosted virtual contact center. Your agents only need a standard computer, a headset, and an internet browser to make/receive calls and manage customer charts."
    },
    {
      q: "Can we design custom chatbots without writing code?",
      a: "Yes. BusinessOS™ features a visual drag-and-drop chatbot canvas. You can build advanced decision trees, specify fallback triggers, link WhatsApp catalog items, and wire checkout integrations effortlessly."
    },
    {
      q: "How secure is our customers' private personal information?",
      a: "We prioritize security. BusinessOS™ uses local AES-256 encrypted tables and operates behind secure Google Cloud (Cloud Run) perimeter firewalls. We adhere strictly to ISO 27001, HIPAA, and GDPR data privacy frameworks."
    },
    {
      q: "What payment gateways are supported for automated chat billing?",
      a: "We integrate seamlessly with Razorpay and Stripe. This allows your chatbots to send secure payment links in WhatsApp or Live Chat, allowing customers to pay with UPI, credit cards, or net banking instantly."
    },
    {
      q: "What is the onboarding process for enterprise migrations?",
      a: "For migrating teams, our dedicated system integration engineers assist in porting phone lines, importing CRM contact indexes, setting up ticketing databases, and holding onboarding workshops for a seamless, zero-downtime transition."
