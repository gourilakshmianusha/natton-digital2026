  const faqs = [
    { q: "How exactly does Natton Digital replace HubSpot or Salesforce?", a: "Traditional CRMs like HubSpot and Salesforce are passive databases that charge aggressively for seats, limits, and contacts, requiring massive secondary tools (Zapier, Agencies, Coders) to automate. Natton provides an AI-first unified platform (GrowthOS™ & BusinessOS™) paired with active, dedicated implementation support. We build your automated pipelines, custom n8n nodes, and conversational AI bots natively, saving you tens of thousands of dollars in hidden SaaS fees." },
    { q: "Can we migrate our existing historical data without losing history?", a: "Absolutely. Our engineering squad handles the complete migration. We map, clean, and transfer all of your contacts, deals, email conversations, tags, and internal notes from HubSpot, Zoho, Salesforce, or Excel sheets safely into your new sovereign Natton database. There is zero downtime during this pipeline switch." },
    { q: "Is the data stored securely? What compliance protocols are followed?", a: "Yes. Data security is built into our core server architecture. All databases are SOC2 Type II and ISO 27001 standard compliant, using AES-256 bank-grade encryption at rest and TLS 1.3 in transit. For medical clients, we deploy HIPAA-compliant secure sandboxed servers." },
    { q: "Do we have to pay per seat or per contact in Natton Digital?", a: "No. Unlike traditional CRM vendors that penalize your scaling success by charging for larger contact limits or added marketing seats, Natton Digital works on flat-rate transparent subscriptions with unlimited contacts and support tiers. Your bills remain predictable as your business grows." },
    { q: "What is the custom n8n integration benefit?", a: "Traditional CRMs force you to use Zapier, which is slow, expensive, and limited in complex branching. Natton Digital integrates custom, pre-configured n8n nodes directly into your workspace. This allows for deep logic loops, loops through databases, raw API hooks, and infinite multi-step automations for a fraction of the cost." },
    { q: "Are the AI Calling agents robotic, or do they sound natural?", a: "Our sovereign Voice AI nodes use next-gen neural voice synthesis, featuring ultra-low latency (under 600ms Response latency), natural breath pauses, adaptive conversational listening, and customizable accents. They hold complete fluid technical conversations and sound exactly like a highly trained human representative." },
    { q: "Does the WhatsApp checkout support native payment routing?", a: "Yes. Our WhatsApp automated catalogs support Meta Pay, custom Stripe checkout links, and UPI/UPI Auto-pay triggers embedded directly inside the conversational chat balloon. Customers can complete transactions without ever exiting their WhatsApp thread." },
    { q: "Can we customize the AI marketing engines to match our exact brand tone?", a: "Yes. Every custom agent and marketing platform node is pre-trained on your specific brand assets, guidelines, historical high-performing ads, and documentation. You get a private sovereign LLM context that matches your corporate voice perfectly." },
    { q: "What is your traditional onboarding timeframe?", a: "While traditional Salesforce or HubSpot enterprise setups drag on for 3 to 6 months with complex integrations, Natton Digital systems are fully built and live in 14 to 21 business days. Our dedicated solutions architect handles everything from API pipes to team training." },
    { q: "What happens if we require new custom automation nodes later?", a: "As part of our premium support, our specialized n8n systems architects are always on call. We continuously update your automation triggers, build new dashboard metrics, design custom LLM routers, and expand your platform functions as your operational models shift." },
    { q: "Is there any lock-in contract?", a: "No. We operate on simple month-to-month or discounted yearly licenses. We align our values strictly with your success — if you do not get clear, transparent ROI, you can cancel at any time." },
    { q: "Can we white-label the GrowthOS dashboard for our own agency clients?", a: "Yes! This is one of our most popular features for partners. You can fully white-label the GrowthOS dashboard, custom agents, and automated portals with your own corporate domains, logo, and brand theme to sell directly to your end-users." },
    { q: "How do you handle captcha or form spam on public landing pages?", a: "We utilize advanced serverless cryptographic challenges alongside invisible honeypot parameters. This blocks 99.99% of automated bot submissions without subjecting real human prospects to annoying image matching tasks." },
    { q: "Do the AI Calling nodes integrate with local telecom lines?", a: "Yes. We support direct integration with Twilio, local SIP trunks, cloud telephony nodes, or your existing business phone setup, letting you make high-volume calls from your existing verified corporate numbers." },
    { q: "Can we build multiple isolated workspace environments?", a: "Yes. Enterprise accounts can provision separate, sandboxed organizational nodes (e.g., for different brands, subdivisions, or regional centers) while maintaining unified analytics in a master cockpit." },
    { q: "How does the ROI guarantee work?", a: "Before we write any lines of code, we run an AI Readiness assessment to calculate your realistic operations audit score. If we don't find at least a 3x projected return on investment, we won't accept your onboarding request." },
    { q: "Is there a limit on WhatsApp message volume?", a: "We operate on native official Meta Cloud APIs. You only pay the direct Meta-regulated business conversation charges (fractions of a cent) directly, with zero markup or messaging limits from our end." },
    { q: "Can the AI Agent write and push code directly to GitHub?", a: "Yes! Our high-end AgenticOS™ packages can be configured with safe container environments to write, test, validate, and commit custom automation scripts directly to client GitHub repositories." },
    { q: "What language routing capabilities are supported?", a: "Our conversational engines, voice agents, and support portals support over 40 languages, automatically detecting customer language in real-time and adjusting responses instantly." },
    { q: "How do we get started with a personalized comparison checklist?", a: "Simply fill out our Personalized Comparison form below, or book a live virtual blueprint demo with one of our systems architects today." }
